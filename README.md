# Fake-news-detection

#                                Purpose
##This project proposes the question of whether it is possible to detect if a job is fake through machine learning models. Speciﬁcally, the ##aim of this project is to determine the ideal model that is eﬃcient in predicting fake job posts.	
##
##Job seekers enter the link of [linkedin,career24] or the info about the vacancy. The system then scraps the data from the website if the ##user provided a link. Then uses the fake_job_postings.csv dataset to train three different classifiers that are used to predict if the ##post is fake or not.
